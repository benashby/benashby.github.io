# Modern Linux Audio Guide

*Last updated: {{ page.last_modified_at | date: "%B %d, %Y" }}*

## Introduction

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of audio systems on modern Linux distributions, covering everything from basic concepts to advanced configuration. The examples and configurations in this guide are primarily tested on **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS**, though most concepts apply to other modern Linux distributions.


## Ubuntu 24.04 Audio Stack

Ubuntu 24.04 LTS marks a significant shift in Linux audio by adopting **PipeWire** as the default audio system, replacing PulseAudio. This modernization brings improved performance, lower latency, and better professional audio support.

### Default Versions Shipped

Ubuntu 24.04 LTS ships with these versions by default:

```bash
# Check PipeWire version
pipewire --version
# Output: pipewire - Compiled with libpipewire 1.0.5

# Check WirePlumber version  
wireplumber --version
# Output: wireplumber - Compiled with libwireplumber 0.4.17
```

### Current Audio Architecture

- **PipeWire 1.0.5**: Core audio/video routing engine
- **WirePlumber 0.4.17**: Session manager for PipeWire
- **ALSA**: Kernel-level hardware interface
- **PulseAudio compatibility**: Maintained through PipeWire's pulse server

### Upgrading to Latest Upstream Versions

For cutting-edge features, bug fixes, and performance improvements, you can upgrade to the latest upstream versions:

```bash
# Add PipeWire upstream PPA (provides PipeWire 1.0.7+)
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:pipewire-debian/pipewire-upstream

# Add WirePlumber upstream PPA (provides WirePlumber 0.5.2+)
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:pipewire-debian/wireplumber-upstream

# Update package lists
sudo apt update

# Upgrade to latest versions
sudo apt dist-upgrade
```

**After upgrade you'll have:**
- **PipeWire 1.0.7** (latest stable)
- **WirePlumber 0.5.2** (latest stable)

### Verification Commands

```bash
# Verify PipeWire is running
systemctl --user status pipewire

# Check PipeWire status and devices
wpctl status

# Get PipeWire server info
wpctl status | grep PipeWire

# Confirm upgraded versions
pipewire --version

## Understanding wpctl status Output

The `wpctl status` command provides a comprehensive view of your PipeWire audio system. Understanding its output is essential for troubleshooting and configuration.

### Audio Component Definitions

Understanding the different components shown in `wpctl status` output:

---

#### üîå Devices
*Physical or virtual audio hardware detected by your system*

| Real-World Examples | How They Appear in wpctl |
|---|---|
| Built-in laptop sound card | `45. Audio Controller [alsa]` |
| USB audio interface | `46. Focusrite Scarlett [alsa]` |
| Bluetooth headphones | `47. Sony WH-1000XM4 [bluetooth]` |
| HDMI audio output | `48. HDMI Audio [alsa]` |

---

#### üîä Sinks (Outputs)
*Where your audio goes - speakers, headphones, etc.*

| Real-World Examples | How They Appear in wpctl |
|---|---|

| USB interface outputs | `*53. Scarlett Solo Analog Stereo [vol: 0.80]` |

*The `*` indicates the **default** sink*

---

*The `*` indicates the **default** source*

---

#### üéµ Streams
*Active audio connections between apps and devices*

| Real-World Examples | How They Appear in wpctl |
|---|---|
| Firefox playing YouTube | `58. Firefox [RUNNING]` |
| Spotify streaming music | `59. Spotify [RUNNING]` |
| OBS recording | `60. obs [RUNNING]` |
| Paused video player | `61. VLC Media Player [IDLE]` |

### Common Status Indicators

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `*` | Default device |
| `[RUNNING]` | Active audio stream |
| `[IDLE]` | Stream exists but not playing |
| `[SUSPENDED]` | Stream paused/suspended |

### Interpreting Device States

**Available devices** appear in the list with their current volume and properties.

**Unavailable devices** may appear grayed out or missing if disconnected.

**Default devices** are marked with `*` and will be used by new applications unless specifically configured otherwise.
wireplumber --version
